## Bootstrap a New System

1. Ensure you are Troy. If you are not Troy, ask yourself why you are doing this, 
   and examine the choices you've made that have lead to this point.
2. Install `curl` or `wget` or whatever.
3. Install SSH identity keys in `~/.ssh`.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   curl -SsLf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troykinsella/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh" | bash
   ```
5. Enjoy some potato flavoured ice cream.
